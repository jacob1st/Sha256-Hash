# Sha256-Hash
A c++ program that implements the Sha-256 hashing algorithm. 

The algorithm is outlined very clearly here: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orIgy2MjqrA is a fantastic video that goes over every step of the algorithm.

My first real attempt at a project in cpp!
